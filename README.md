## Project Build
- HTML5
- CSS3
- pseudo element (::after)
- Media queries
- variables

Given most of the element for the project (image, design (Figma), and style guide). Provided with the content, but need to use HTML tags to create how the page should be displayed (both for screen readers and in general). Utilized headings, ul and ol list.

CSS - used variables from the style guide (incase the values need to change in the future). Everything from color, fonts, size, and weight. Created mobile first and the used 2 media queries for tablet and desktop.

## Learning

First time actually doing a table without instructions. I had taken course about the tables, but never used them. I thought the nutrition section was a perfect way to dive into tables. Though, there was no header, I still just used tr and td which worked perfectly. Styling was a bit tricker for me, but in the end got the result I was looking for.

ul/ol was tricking since the word wrap was not suppose to under the bullet/number point. I learned about list-style-position of outside and inside. I chose outside so the wrapping would only be with the words.


## Progress continue

I will not do more with this project other than possible be revisiting it and see if I can clean up the code, make it DRY, or use some method I have not learned yet.
